## What I did, and why I did it

I made a 3D game in Unity 2021, which is a hack ’n’ slash game in which you need to defeat a boss to win the game. The game was supposed to be an Action RPG, but I wasn’t able to add the RPG elements to the game such as being able to level up due to time limitations and to prevent the game from having additional bugs. In it, you’re a swordsman called “Fang”, and you need to defeat an evil robot called “The Imanus”. 
		
Well, to make the game, I created 4 scenes: one for the Main Menu or “Press Start” screen, another one for the gameplay itself, a third one for a Game Over Screen, and another one with a victory message once you defeat the boss.
	
You need to press Enter in the Press Start / Main Menu scene in order to play the game. Also, in the Main Menu scene, if you press the “Esc” key, you will be able to exit the game.
	
In the game, I created a single level using the Probuilds tools from Unity. I created a single arena for the game, which is where the player and the only enemy of the game will fight. I created 4 planes around the boss’ arena. These planes act like a wall to prevent the player from walking off the edge of the arena and fall into a bottomless pit. Still, I don’t recommend the players getting too close to the walls, since the floor’s collision detection gets wonky near the walls, and the player seems to fall if they get too close to the walls.

	
You will need to attack the enemy as fast as possible to defeat him. Otherwise, the enemy will defeat you. There’s no way to heal in the game. You start with 40 points of Health, whereas the enemy will start with 100 points of Health. You can deal 13 points of damage, while the enemy deals 4 points of damage. For the time being, this was the only way to balance the difficulty. That is, if you attack the enemy quickly enough, you will be able to defeat him and win. Otherwise, if you take too long in attacking him, the enemy will defeat you, and you’ll get a game over. 
	
You need to left-click to move, and right click on the enemy to attack him.
	
If the enemy doesn’t spot you, he will remain idle and won’t move. However, if you get close enough, the enemy will chase you.
	
Once you defeat the enemy, you will go to a new scene that will display a message saying “Victory!”. The only thing that you can do here is pressing Enter to go back to the Main Menu. This way, you’ll be able to replay the game or to exit the game if you go back to the Main Menu.
	
Similarly, if you’re defeated and get to the scene displaying a “Game Over” message, the only thing that you’ll be able to do is to press Enter to go back to the Main Menu. Once again, I did this so that you could easily replay the game or exit it by making you quickly go from the Game Over scene to the Main Menu scene.
	
The Health Points for both the player and the enemy are displayed onscreen as numbers. If the enemy’s HP drops to zero, you win. Meanwhile, if your HP drops to zero, you lose and you’ll get a Game Over. I put the UI Text with the HP in the lower corners of the screen so that the black text would be easy to read on the white floor of the game. If I had put the HP UI text in the upper part of the screen, I would have had to add a mask or colored-box with a light color so that the player would be able to easily read the black text on the background. Therefore, to make the game as quickly as possible, I ended up just moving the HP UI text to the lower part of the screen.
	
The game is relatively simple. I had no choice but to make the game this simple to prevent many bugs. I had bugs that made the camera shake too much, that made the enemy and the player fall if they collided with each other, among other bugs. Therefore, I didn’t have a choice but to make the game simple to prevent many of the bugs that I was encountering.
	
I added some 3D Models from the Unity Asset Store for Fang and The Imanus, that is, for the player and for the enemy. I looked up some free samurai or knight 3D models from the Unity Asset Store, and found a medieval cartoon knight that I ended up using for the player character. The knight already has a sword, movement, and sword animations. It’s good enough for the player character for the time being. As for the enemy, I ended up using a free Unity asset of a robot. I only needed a simple robot that looked hostile. You need to add these 2 assets for the game to work properly, if I don’t include it with the source code. Here’s the 3D model for the player character: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/medieval-cartoon-warriors-90079#publisher . Meanwhile, here’s the 3D model for the enemy: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/robots/medium-mech-striker-124342 .
	
For the physics of the game, I left both the player and the enemy with kinematic physics. First, I had to add a Rigid Body to both the player and the boss. Then, I made them kinematic. That is, if they collide with each other, neither of them will be pushed around, nor fall to the floor. I did this since, if I left the “is kinematic” value unchecked in the Unity editor, many bugs occurred. The player wouldn’t be able to get close to the enemy without falling to the floor. Also, if the enemy touched the player’s 3D model, the enemy would end up falling to the floor, and then he would start flying. 
	
For the collision detection, I used a capsule collider. The 3D models that I ended up using were the complex 3D models of the medieval cartoon character and the robot. However, the actual collision detection is detected via a capsule collider. That is, there’s an invisible capsule surrounding both the player and the enemy 3D models, which handles collision. I did this since capsules are normally used for collision detection for characters in games, since the rounded area on the top of the capsule would simulate the roundedness of the character’s head. That is, if you attack the character’s head, it would be better detected by the game by using a capsule collider than a box collider. And of course, I didn’t add a complex collision detection mesh that would detect the entire shape of the knight nor the robot 3D model, since doing that would use too many resources, and would make the game run too slowly. So, instead, I used a simpler capsule collider for the collision detection.



### How to play

To play this game, you need to left click to move, right click to attack with your sword. If you run out of Health points, you die and get a game over, and if you deplete the enemy’s HP, you win the game.
	
You can exit the game by pressing the “Esc” key in the Title scene in the Main Menu.
	
If you get a Game Over or you win the game, you can press Enter to go back to the Main Menu.
	
You can rotate the camera by pressing the “A” and “D” keys, and you can zoom the camera in or out by rotating the Mouse wheel.


## Why I believe it to meet the complexity and distinctiveness requirement

My game is made in Unity, which makes it more complex than around half of the homework assignments for GD50. Out of the 11 or so assignments, only 3 assignments required you to use Unity (four if you do your final project with Unity). The rest of the assignments, which are around 8, require you to use Lua and Love2D. Given that 3D Unity games are way more complex than 2D games made in Love2D, and given that my game for my final project is a 3D Unity game, my game is more complex than most of the assignments for this course. So, since it’s a 3D Unity game, that gives some level of complexity to my project when compared to other assignments in this course.

Also, of the 3D games in this course, no other game has a 3rd person camera that you can control mid-gameplay other than mine. Out of the most complex games in the course, which are the 3D Unity games, they either have a first person camera, or use a 3rd person camera at a fixed angle. Well, my game uses a 3rd person camera that you can both rotate, and zoom in and out. I had to look up a tutorial on the internet to find out how to make a 3rd person camera in Unity that you can control while playing the game. So, I needed to learn some extra things that were not taught in previous homework assignments to make my final project. Therefore, the fact that I had to learn how to implement a controllable 3rd person camera in a 3D game makes my project some level of complexity, since I couldn’t copy and paste the code for handling cameras from other of my previous projects.

Another reason why my project is more complex than previous homework assignments is the number of 3D animations that I used in my Unity project, when compared to the other Unity projects for previous homework assignments. The portal homework assignment didn’t have any animations whatsoever. The Dreadhalls assignment only had 1 animation: the rotation for the 3D model of the pickup. Similarly, the Helicopter Game only had 1 animation for the player character, for the enemies, and for the diamonds and coins. The diamonds and coins only used a rotation effect for their animations, which is a basic type of animation. As for the player character in the Helicopter game, it only had the “idle” animation for the helicopter, in which the helicopter’s blades were rotating, and the explosion animation when you crashed onto something. I think the enemies also had an “idle” animation. So, in the Helicopter game, there were like a total of 4 or 5 animations, in which all items and most characters had only 1 animation. Additionally, I technically didn’t have to add any animations to any of the games. With probably the exception of the Helicopter game’s diamonds, I didn’t have to add any animations for any of the previous homework assignments. Meanwhile, my game for my final project had way more animations than any other previous homework assignment in the GD50 course.

I had to manually add animations for my game for my final project. I added animations for both the player character and the enemy. I had to configure the animator controllers for both the player and the enemy, as well as find free assets that would come with pre-installed animations. I never had to look up nor any assets from the Unity Store for any of the previous projects. Also, I never had to configure the animations by using the animator controller in the Unity editor in previous homework assignments. So, since I had to learn how to install new assets from the Unity store, and that I had to learn how to configure the animator controllers for the characters in the game, my game is more complex than previous homework assignments.

Likewise, my game used more animations than any other previous project in this couse. The playable character has at least three types of animations: one for being idle, one for running, and one attacking. Well, since the player character has both a walk and a running animation, and since the player gets into a combat stance animation right after swinging his sword, the total number of animations is of at least 5, and just for the player character. Also, since the player character has 2 sword slashing animations when he attacks, the player character alone technically has 6 animations. Meanwhile, the enemy has its own number of animations. It has animations for walking, running, idle, and both a left punch and a right punch attack animation. So, the enemy alone has at least 5 animations. So, combining the number of animations for both the player and the enemy, there are at least 11 animations in my final project. No 3D unity game in the course has this many animations. So, my final project is more complex than previous projects in the course.

Also, my project is complex since I had to make the entire level from scratch. With the only exception of the Portal project, all the walls and the floors for all the 3D Unity games in the course were already pre-installed with the game. Meanwhile, in my final project, I had to build all the walls and the floor for the combat arena present in the game using the Probuilds level editor. This makes it similar to the Portal project. Well, since the Portal project was more complex than pretty much every other project in the course, and given that I had to build levels in a similar fashion in my final project as in the Portal assignment, my game is more complex than most other previous homework assignments. 


## Lore and background information

The enemy of this game is a killer robot who killed the biological parents of a 10 year old child called “Keith”, and it stole a medal from Keith. Keith’s medal was a memento from his parents, since Keith and his biological parents won that medal in a game at a school event in which parents could participate with their children. The Imanus took that medal since it seemed valuable, and as a trophy for having killed Keith’s parents. The Imanus was the leader from a group of evil terrorist robots that attacked Keith’s village and killed other innocent civilians in the village.
	
Fang was able to scare away both The Imanus and the robots that were attacking Keith’s village. Since Fang saw that Keith didn’t have anywhere to go, Fang took care of Keith. After enjoying taking care of Keith for a few days, Fang decides to adopt Keith. Well, after a few conversations, Keith tells Fang that the Imanus stole his medal. Therefore, Fang decided to go find The Imanus to finish the job, avenge Keith’s parents, and retrieve Keith’s medal, which was a memento of his parents.
	
This is a sidequest of a full game called “Keith” that I want to make someday. The idea of Fang tracking The Imanus to retrieve Keith’s medal is an idea that I had since 2 years ago. This mission will be a sidequest in the full game, once I finish it.
	
Note that I made a web game for the Web50 course called “Keith”, which also takes place in the same game world as this Unity game. However, the web game was a 2D game made in Javascript, and it played liek a 2D sidescroller, and it had RPG elements, such as being able to level up. Also, enemies couldn’t either attach nor move in the web version of the game. So, this unity game is completely different from the Keith web game that I did for web 50.

Boss Mechanics: - "The Imanus": Final boss with various attack phases'. I've attached you some of my own drawings to represent some of the boss mechanics. ost of the images show the boss' attacks. In the first image, I show that the boss will be able to summon some laser balls that will surround the player to then hurt him. In the 2nd image, I show an attack in which the boss lunges at the player to tackle him (the boss is the one with horns and a crown). In the 4th image, I show the boss launching missiles at the player as one of his attacks. Then, in the 3rd image (yes, it's in the wrong order), I show a sketch that shows that, if the player hits the missile with his sword, the missile will be sent back to the boss, and damage the boss. The boss will also become staggered by that missile hit, which will give the opportunity to the player to land multiple hits to the boss. Those images and these descriptions that I've been writing are a summary of the boss' attacks and mechanics.

Could you tell me how to make the player character touch the boss character without either of them falling to the floor? What I did in both the player character and the boss character was to create a 3D capsule game object, attach a RigidBody component to the capsule, and drag and drop the character's game object inside of the capsule. Thanks to that, they're both affected by gravity, and if they touch the floor, they won't clip through the floor. However, right now, the capsule's 3D model is covering 3D model of each character. Also, there's the issue that, if the player touches the boss, the player falls to the ground.

Should I make a build of my unity game, and press esc to make sure that the game closes when I press the escape key? I'm using the 2021 version of Unity. Attached an image showing my Unity Editor with the debug message saying that I exited the game. Accessed on May 19th, 2024.
35. ChatGPT Omni. (2024). "Awesome. That worked. However, my game has some bugs that only show up on the Build, but NOT on the Unity Editor. For instance, I start from a scene called "Main", instead of the "Press Start" scene. Also, the player moves way too slowly on the build. Finally, I attached a capsule to a 3D model of a medieval cartoon character, and, on the build, the capsule detaches from the cartoon character, so the capsule moves, but the cartoon character doesn't. These bugs occur only on the build, but not on the Unity Editor. Maybe I need to eliminate all my scenes from the “File -> Build Settings” window, and add them again from scratch? What's going on?"

38. Pycharm Copilot. (2024). I want the main character of my Unity game, Fang, to have a property called "HP", which will store Fang's health points. He will initially have 100 points of HP. HP will be an integer. Well, I want to insert into the playable character's equivalent of it's "init()" function the property that will store their HP. Well, give me an algorithm that will let me assign new properties to the playable character, and create a property called "HP", which will be an integer. Tell me if it's better to create a new script, or if I should insert the "HP" property into one of my existing scripts. Just give me an algorithm for it. Accessed on May 25th, 2024.
39. Pycharm Copilot. (2024). The thing is, as the name of that script suggests, that script is only supposed to handle the player's movement. I think it would be better to just create a new script to store the properties of the playable character, such as his stats (attack, defense, HP, etc).

The player is a 3D model with a capsule attached to it. Well, the player's capsule falls down if the enemy capsule touches it. Well, what I want is that the enemy capsule should touch the player's capsule, so that the enemy hurts and deals damage to the player if the enemy touches the player.

Awesome, now, I want you to modify the selected line of code so that my UI text in my Unity game prints me the current health points of the player, as well as the max number of health points that the player has at full health. You need to concatenate tht to the side of the "Fang: " script. Where are the current health points and the max health points stored? In the CharacterStats.cs script. The current health points are stored in the "currentHealth" variable in the CharacterStats.cs script. Meanwhile, the max number of health points at full health are stored in the "maxHealth" variable in the CharacterStats.cs script. To call those HP related variables, first, the game calls the PlayerCharacterStats.cs script, which then calls the CharacterStats.cs script.
