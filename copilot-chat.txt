/fix I'm making a 3D unity game which is a 3rd-person Action RPG in which you fight against a boss by using your sword. This script handles the movement of the playable character, who's called "Fang". Well, this code lets the player walk, and, if they walk to a side, they will turn around. However, the camera shakes whenever the player moves. On the default speed, which is of "5", is not that noticeable, but the player walks too slowly. At higher speeds, the player can move quick, but the camera shakes so much that it gives me motion sickness, making the game virtually unplayable. Meanwhile, if I remove any rotation from this code, and use "transform.Translate(movement * speed * Time.deltatime)", the player can move quickly and the camera won't shake, but the 3D model won't be able to rotate when wakling to a side or backwards. So please, take this snippet, and tell me what should I do in my Unity game to remove that camera shake whenever the player character moves by using this script.


**Problem 1: Player moves too slowly**

The player's movement speed is currently set to 5, which is causing the player to move too slowly.

**Solution:**

Increase the speed variable to a higher value. This will make the player move faster.

**Before:**
```csharp
public float speed = 5f;
```

**After:**
```csharp
public float speed = 10f; // Adjust this value as needed
```

**Problem 2: Camera shakes when player moves**

The camera shake is likely due to the way the player's rotation is being handled. The current code is using `Quaternion.RotateTowards` to smoothly rotate the player, but this might be causing the camera to shake if it's attached to the player.

**Solution:**

Instead of rotating the player, rotate the direction of movement. This will allow the player to move in the desired direction without physically rotating the player object (and the attached camera).

**Before:**
```csharp
if (movement.magnitude > 0.1f)
{
    Quaternion newRotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(movement);
    rb.rotation = Quaternion.RotateTowards(rb.rotation, newRotation, rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
}
```

**After:**
```csharp
if (movement.magnitude > 0.1f)
{
    movement = Quaternion.Euler(0, Camera.main.transform.eulerAngles.y, 0) * movement;
}
```

Here is the complete fixed version of the code:

```csharp
public class PlayerMovement : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float speed = 10f;
    public float rotationSpeed = 720.0f;
    public float jumpForce = 300f;
    private Rigidbody rb;

    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }

    void Update()
    {
        float moveHorizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float moveVertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

        Vector3 movement = new Vector3(moveHorizontal, 0.0f, moveVertical);

        if (movement.magnitude > 0.1f)
        {
            movement = Quaternion.Euler(0, Camera.main.transform.eulerAngles.y, 0) * movement;
        }

        rb.MovePosition(transform.position + movement * speed * Time.deltaTime);

        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
        {
            rb.AddForce(new Vector3(0, jumpForce, 0));
        }
    }
}
```

Please note that the camera should be independent of the player for this solution to work. If the camera is a child of the player in the hierarchy, you might need to adjust your camera setup.

====================================================================================================

/explain That didn't work. The camera is still shaking while I move. Please, tell me what the selected snippet does. Then, tell me if you can find out what's causing the camera shaking.

The selected code snippet is part of the `Update` method in the `PlayerMovement` class. This method is called once per frame in Unity, and it's where the logic for player movement and rotation is handled.

The first two lines of the `Update` method retrieve the horizontal and vertical input from the user. These inputs are typically provided by the arrow keys or WASD keys on the keyboard.

```csharp
float moveHorizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
float moveVertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
```

These inputs are then used to create a `Vector3` movement vector. This vector represents the direction and magnitude of the player's movement.

```csharp
Vector3 movement = new Vector3(moveHorizontal, 0.0f, moveVertical);
```

The code then checks if the magnitude of the movement vector is significant (greater than 0.1). If it is, the player's rotation is updated. The player's rotation is smoothly updated to face the direction of movement using `Quaternion.RotateTowards`.

```csharp
if (movement.magnitude > 0.1f)
{
    Quaternion newRotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(movement);
    rb.rotation = Quaternion.RotateTowards(rb.rotation, newRotation, rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
}
```

Finally, the player's position is updated based on the movement vector, the player's speed, and the time since the last frame.

```csharp
rb.MovePosition(transform.position + movement * speed * Time.deltaTime);
```

As for the camera shaking issue, it's likely due to the camera being a child of the player object in the Unity hierarchy. When the player object rotates, the child camera object also rotates, which can cause a shaking effect. This is especially noticeable when the player's rotation is updated frequently, as it is in this code. To fix this, you could try making the camera independent of the player in the Unity hierarchy, or adjust the way the player's rotation is handled.

====================================================================================================

/fix The FollowCamera.cs script is the one that generates the camera shaking bug. I want the camera to follow the player character while they move. However, the camera shakes whenever the player moves. So please, modify this function so that the camera stops shaking while the player moves. This script is currently attached to the camera game object.

**Problem 1: Camera shakes when player moves**

The camera shake is likely due to the way the camera's position is being interpolated in the `LateUpdate` method. The current code is using `Vector3.Lerp` to smoothly transition the camera's position from its current position to the desired position. However, this might be causing the camera to shake if the player's position changes frequently.

**Solution:**

Instead of using `Vector3.Lerp`, use `Vector3.SmoothDamp`. This function gradually changes a vector towards a desired goal over time. The function can be controlled by a speed parameter, which should be provided as a member variable.

**Before:**
```csharp
Vector3 smoothedPosition = Vector3.Lerp(transform.position, desiredPosition, smoothSpeed);
transform.position = smoothedPosition;
```

**After:**
```csharp
Vector3 velocity = Vector3.zero;
transform.position = Vector3.SmoothDamp(transform.position, desiredPosition, ref velocity, smoothSpeed);
```

Here is the complete fixed version of the code:

```csharp
public class FollowCamera : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform target;
    public Vector3 offset = new Vector3(0, 5, -10);
    public float smoothSpeed = 0.125f;
    private Vector3 velocity = Vector3.zero;

    void LateUpdate()
    {
        Vector3 desiredPosition = target.position + offset;
        transform.position = Vector3.SmoothDamp(transform.position, desiredPosition, ref velocity, smoothSpeed);
        transform.LookAt(target);
    }
}
```

Please note that the `smoothSpeed` variable controls the speed of the camera's movement. Adjust this value as needed to achieve the desired camera behavior.
